<b>DATA COLLECTION NOTICE</b><br><br>

Autodesk respects your privacy.  For details, please see our Privacy Statement located at <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/privacy">www.autodesk.com/privacy</a> and specific Privacy Notices and Data Collection Notices in our applications.<br><br>
 
In order to support ongoing product improvement efforts, Autodesk receives aggregated product usage information about this application.  This information consists of: product launch and closure which allows us to calculate length and number of application sessions; whether a connection was successful or failed; general geographic location (to city level); general application commands and operations used (e.g., which functions are used more often);  as well as general mobile device information such as OS version and device type.  <br><br>
 
We use the Google Analytics SDK, which collects information and then presents the data to us in aggregated form.  The Google Analytics software agent collects the following data: agent version, platform, SDK version, platform timestamp, API key (identifier for application), application version, device identifier, Model (non-iOS), manufacture (non-iOS) and OS version of device (non-iOS), session start/stop time, events, errors and page views (for example, clicking on buttons or links, and whether or not it worked, all of which is reported to us in aggregate), locale (specific location where a given language is spoken), time zone, and network status (WiFi, etc.). The device identifiers (if applicable), IMEI (if applicable), MAC address (if applicable), and platform are hashed to a Google ID.  Note that Google will see Internet Protocol (IP) address through the HTTP request to send information.  For clarity, Autodesk does not receive geo-location data (i.e. GPS coordinates).<br><br>
 
If you would like to opt-out so that data is not sent to Google and then aggregated for Autodesk, please take the following steps depending on what type of device you are using.  iOS device: Go to the in-app settings and switch the in-application toggle to “off” to prevent data being sent to Google.  Alternatively, if the app does not have in-app settings, go to device settings and switch the in-application toggle to “off” to prevent data being sent to Google.   Android device:  Go to the in-app menu settings and uncheck the “approve data collection” box.  Note that changing the toggle to “off” (iOS) or unchecking the box (Android) mid-session will prevent data being sent to Google as of the next use session.
